### Homework 2 (due Thursday, September 20, 2018)

THis homework has two parts. First, follow up on our in-class work. Second, prepare for our next class session by watching a few videos and answering some questions.

You will be submitting each homework assignment into a new GitHub repository each week. [Here are instructions on how to do so.](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide/blob/master/README.md) Please [email me](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu) if you have any questions!

#### Classwork wrap-up

**Assignment**: In class, we wrote and adapted code to create [Mondrian](https://www.google.com/search?q=mondrian&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL5_mk3sDdAhUB84MKHW6aAt4Q_AUIDigB&biw=1521&bih=943) look-alikes. Post two of your favorite dynamic (i.e., not one unchanging image) Mondrian-esque pieces to your class repository!

#### Animations & Variables in p5

In class, we [briefly touched on](../README.md) animations in p5, and how to use variables to track changes acrsos frames.

Watch the following Daniel Shiffman videos about variables and animation in p5 and Javascript: [2.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnS0YNuLfQQ&index=7&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [2.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn_B3T_Vbxs&index=8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [3.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn_B3T_Vbxs&index=8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [3.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO3Awjn_gyU&index=13&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [3.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2S7j54I68c&index=14&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), and [3.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk-_syQluvc&index=15&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).

Consider the code we wrote together in class:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

var x = 10;
var changeInX = 3;

function draw() {
  background(220);
  
  ellipse(x, 200, 40);
  
  x = x + changeInX;
  
  if (x > width) {
    changeInX = -3;
  }
  
  if (x < 0) {
    changeInX = 3;
  }
}
```


1. **Assignment**: Add other variables to the code above to have other parts of the animation change over time. Perhaps color? Or size? Shape? Speed?

2. **Assignment**: Add a second circle. As a first attempt, you can just draw a second circle at a different y-coordinate in your code, using the existing variables. 
   
   But what if you want two completely independent circles that can start in different places and go at different speeds? (Hint: you'll probably need to have a copy of each variable for each circle.)
   
   **(Optional) Challenge**: Modify the code to draw three independent circles, each with their own variables.
   

#### HSB: Another way to look at color

Now consider the following code:

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(220);
  // HSB with H range 0-400, S range 0-400, B range 0-100:
	colorMode(HSB, 400, 400, 100);
}

function draw() {
	let x = random(width);
  let y = random(height);
  fill(x, y, 100);
  noStroke()
  ellipse(x, y, 20);
}
```

This code uses the location of each circle to determine its color. The `x` coordinate is *also* used in the `fill` command. **Remember, these are just numbers.** It's how they're **used** that gives them meaning.

**Assignment**: Modify the `HSB` above to `RGB`.

None of the numbers change, just what those numbers **represent**.

**Assignment**: Rename the `x` and `y` variables `h` and `s` (for "hue" and "saturation"). In your `README.me` file, answer: what changes in the animation?
